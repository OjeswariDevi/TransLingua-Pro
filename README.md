## 🔐 Security Implementation

Security was given high priority during development:

- API keys are stored using environment variables
- `.env` file is excluded via `.gitignore`
- No sensitive credentials are hardcoded
- Streamlit Cloud Secrets Manager is used for production deployment

This ensures secure handling of API credentials.
